## Day 1 report:

We choosed to focus on backend first, so we used Bootstrap to have a working design in a easy way. (will be improved later)

the first goal was to create a common index to ensure good organisation.

We "mapped" all the functions needed to manage correctly all the task to accomplish.

we made a simple directory in Sass to prevent merge conflicts.

globally, it's quite cool to don't have struggles with design at the beginning.

The girls are very good and fast with javascript. what a team !!!

Nor real issues, just some struggles with some 'bouts de codes' as usual.

## Day 2 report:

We finished all the backends tasks, and still some bonus features to implement if we have the time.
Globally, we can focus on design, we put a deadline for the designing for tomorrow morning.
I personnaly had some issues with branching --> always be sure of the branch you're working on.
