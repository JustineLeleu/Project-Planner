## Day 1 report:

We choosed to focus on backend first, so we used Bootstrap to have a working design in a easy way. (will be improved later)

the first goal was to create a common index to ensure good organisation.

We "mapped" all the functions needed to manage correctly all the task to accomplish.

we made a simple directory in Sass to prevent merge conflicts.

globally, it's quite cool to don't have struggles with design at the beginning.

The girls are very good (and fast) at Javascript, I'm quite disapointed of my lack of skills.
